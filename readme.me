## Script downloads music from youtube musik playlists This is the solution to my simple problem, if it helped you too, I'd be happy.

# To use it, just paste your copied text from the playlist page into the ymus.txt file, it will look like the contents of ymus.txt. 
![like this](https://github.com/Jahamars/ymus/use.png) 
# download yt_dlp 
```bash
pip install yt_dlp
```
# first run sort.py then download.py .
